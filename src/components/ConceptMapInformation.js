						<h3>Component of a Concept Map</h3>
						<p><b>Nodes</b> correspond to the concepts or important terms related to your studies of a topic. For example, the concept "water" can be defined by other concepts, such as liquid, solid, and gas.</p>
						<br/>
						<p><b>Labeled links</b> identify the type of relationship. The line between a pair of concepts denotes a relationship, and the label on the line tells how the two concepts are related. 
						For example, in a concept map of seasons, the relationship between the amount of sunlight and temperature variations is labeled as "cause" â€“ in other words it is an action relationship between antecedent and consequent. </p>
